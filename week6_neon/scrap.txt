## Downloading data from the NEON Portal to UFApps

You can use the NEON Data Portal to download NEON data directly to your computer as a .zip file. **Because we will want to open the data we download in R on UFApps**, we want to download the data **to your file storage on UFApps**.

To do this:
  
  - Go to the landing page for UFApps (the page with all the app icons - in my web browser, the tab is called "Citrix Receiver")
- Launch the Google Chrome app
- Navigate to the data portal in the Chrome window **within UFApps**: http://data.neonscience.org/
  - Search for a data package and use the online interface to download it as a .zip file.
- When the download has completed, exit the Chrome window within UFApps.
- Go back to the landing page and launch the M Drive app. - Open the Downloads folder.
- Confirm that there is a .zip folder there that you just downloaded. It will have a name like "NEON_temp-air-single".
- Select it. You may get a warning that opening files can be harmful to your computer; dismiss it.
- In the file explorer, select "Move to" and then "Choose location".
- In the window that pops up, navigate to `UFApps > Documents > EVS3000L > week6`. Select the `week6` folder and click Move.
- Exit the M drive app.
